# Frontend Git Submodule Setup

This directory is designed to be used as a **git submodule** pointing to the separate `spotcove-frontend` repository.

## Architecture

- **Main Repository**: `chandanGoa/SpotCove-Ecommerce` (private, core business logic)
- **Frontend Repository**: `chandanGoa/spotcove-frontend` (public, deployment target)
- **Relationship**: Frontend is a git submodule of the main repository

## Complete Isolation

The frontend is **completely self-contained** and can be deployed independently:

✅ **No dependencies on parent repository**
- Local copy of `@spotcove/render-runtime` in `packages/render-runtime/`
- All static data (themes, layouts, products) in `src/data/`
- Independent `package.json` with local dependencies only

✅ **Builds in isolation**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # Uses local packages/render-runtime
npm run build  # Builds successfully without parent repo
```

✅ **Deployable alone**
```bash
# Can be deployed from the spotcove-frontend repo directly
cd spotcove-frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm start  # or deploy to Vercel/Netlify
```

## Sync Logic (Core Can Edit Submodule)

The core repository can access and edit files in the submodule:

1. **Clone with submodules**:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/chandanGoa/SpotCove-Ecommerce.git
   ```

2. **Make changes to frontend** (from core repo):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   # Edit theme/layout files
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update theme logic"
   git push  # Pushes to spotcove-frontend repo
   ```

3. **Update submodule reference in core**:
   ```bash
   cd ..  # Back to main repo
   git add frontend  # Updates submodule pointer
   git commit -m "Update frontend submodule"
   git push
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Deployment Isolation**: Frontend can be deployed from its own repo to spotcove.com
2. **Security**: Core business logic never exposed publicly
3. **Sync**: Core can still edit and sync theme/layout logic
4. **Clean Separation**: Clear boundary between public and private code

## Conversion Steps (For Setup)

1. Remove current frontend directory from main repo tracking
2. Add as submodule pointing to spotcove-frontend repository
3. Push current content to spotcove-frontend
4. Main repo references submodule at specific commit

## Deployment

Frontend (spotcove-frontend) can be deployed independently:

- **Vercel**: Connect to `chandanGoa/spotcove-frontend` repo
- **Netlify**: Connect to `chandanGoa/spotcove-frontend` repo
- **Custom**: Clone spotcove-frontend and deploy

Main repo is **never deployed publicly**.
